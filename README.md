<h3 align="left">What's on my mind:</h3>
I want to make a self driving RC car, How I plan on working towards it:
<p align="left">
  
1. Make a Unity racing game
2. Design a self learning program on python to output analog data to drive the car in Unity
3. Get an RC car and strap Ardiunos and electronics on and upload python program
4. Debug and repeat step 3-4 as many times as needed to optmize <!--The Real #4 Pray to god that debugging doesn't take to long-->
